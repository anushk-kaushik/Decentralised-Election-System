# Decentralised-Election-System
Developed a cutting-edge smart contract using Solidity programming language that ensured a completely fair, transparent, and tamper-proof election process. The contract was designed to serve the best interests of both the candidates and the voters by eliminating any chances of fraud and double voting.

To achieve this, the contract took into account the unique address of each user, ensuring that no voter could cast multiple votes. This feature made the election process more secure and transparent.

In addition to this, the contract also incorporated Zero Knowledge Proof, a highly advanced cryptographic technique that offers complete privacy and security to users. It ensured that the identity of both the candidates and voters remained anonymous while preserving the validity of their addresses.

Overall, the smart contract provided a state-of-the-art solution to the challenges of conducting a fair and transparent election process, thereby enhancing the trust and credibility of the entire electoral system
